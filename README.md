# Tracking X1 Purchases in Personal Capital

Goal: Build a bridge to export transactions from Mint (which X1 Card integrates with, because of Intuit) to Personal Capital (Yodlee, not yet supported).
The default is to pull the last 2 (for testing, change later) days of transactions.

Assumptions:
* You have linked your X1 card with Mint, and the account exists correctly in Mint
